# ⟫ Full-Transection-Handling-Small-Project.
"Made using Core and Advanced Java, and for data manipulation used MySQL and JDBC. Fully secure and reliable features."

# ⟫ Full Transaction Handling Small Project

## ⟫ About This Project
This is a simple transaction handling system that I built to practice my Java and MySQL skills. The project focuses on database operations like inserting, updating, and retrieving transaction data with proper error handling.

## ⟫ What I Learned
- Working with JDBC for database connectivity
- Implementing batch processing for multiple transactions
- Managing database connections properly
- Creating and executing SQL queries
- Handling database transactions safely

## ⟫ Technologies Used
- Java - Core Java for application logic
- MySQL - Database for storing transaction data
- JDBC - For database connectivity and operations

```

## ⟫ Features
-  ✓ Insert new transaction records
-  ✓  Update existing transaction data
-  ✓  Retrieve transaction information
-  ✓  Batch processing for multiple operations
-  ✓  Proper error handling and connection management

## ⟫ How to Run
1. Make sure you have MySQL installed and running
2. Create a database for the project
3. Update the database connection details in the Java files
4. Compile and run the Java files
5. Use the SQL files to set up your database tables

## ⟫ What This Project Does
This system can handle basic transaction operations like adding new transactions, updating transaction details, and fetching transaction history. I've also implemented batch processing to handle multiple transactions efficiently.

## ⟫ Future Improvements
- Add a GUI interface using Java Swing
- Implement more complex transaction validations
- Add user authentication features
- Create better error logging
